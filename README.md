# SeeTp-MinecraftPlugin
This is a minecraft plugin which gives players the ability to toggle the toggleTp command.
Doing so will allow players to rick click with any stick to teleport them to the block they were looking at.

Updates:
You now keep the same direction you were facing before you teleported, after you teleport.
New max teleportation range is 100 blocks.
